 # Google Calendar Countdown App (Python)

Allows the user to create a pseudo countdown on their Google Calendar to automatically update their google calendar with new events that act as countdown markers to their selected goal.


## Installation

Create a copy of this [template repo](https://github.com/afv14/google-calendar-countdown), then clone or download your new repo onto your local computer (for example to the Desktop), and navigate there from the command-line:

```sh
cd ~/Desktop/google-calendar-countdown-py/
```

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "calendar-env":

```sh
conda create -n calendar-env python=3.8
conda activate calendar-env
```

Then, within an active virtual environment, install package dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
